It this folder there's a program written in Python 3 that helped me with one of the steps I need to take to complete my master's thesis. 
It allows the user to cut nucleotide/amino acid sqeuence in FASTA format file based on given input range.
After this step it writes to the final file all of the sequence fragments (for example certain genes)
